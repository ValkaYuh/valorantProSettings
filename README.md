# What is this?

This is a script that automatically imports the following information: Name, eDPI, Mousepad, Outline color, BFI (ON or OFF).
If the information for a certain pro player already exists, it will instead update the entry. The script can also generate the template needed.
All commands are listed when you enter the "help" command after running the script.
The template also has included formulas that display the average eDPI across all players, and also a break down of the BFI setting usage.

# How to use?

Pip install `openpyxl` and `selenium`, then simply run the script. You can always use the "help" command if you need help. When you're done you can close it with the "exit" command.
